<title>Andrea Sanchez - Bio</title>
</head>

<body>
My name is Andrea Sanchez, and I am a Policy Studies and Political Science double major interested in government and the creation of legislation proposals. I currently have a 3.7 GPA, am a frequent Dean’s List recipient, and am Executive Vice President of Syracuse University’s Alpha Omicron Chapter of Alpha Kappa Psi, the world’s oldest and largest professional business fraternity. As a first-generation student, my heavy involvement on campus brings a sense of self pride. Outside of work, I enjoy working out, doing makeup and nails, and exploring new and unknown cities and places. My favorite TV shows are Grey’s Anatomy and Flashpoint. I am the oldest of three siblings, and I live with my mom and dad in the Bronx, New York. I also have two cats, named Luna and Estrella, Spanish for Moon and Star.
