<h2> Where I’ve Been, Who I Am, and Where I’m Going </h2>

<p> When asked what my favorite thing about studying abroad in Madrid, Spain was, I think back to our many walking tours across the city as a part of the program the school did to incentivize us to explore. One of my favorite things about exploring Madrid and other parts of Spain was my ability to walk through history. Walking through the Plaza del Dos de Mayo made me realize history was no longer just something I read about in textbooks or lectured on in class; it was something I was observing for myself. Plaza del Dos de Mayo marked the commencement of the Spanish War of Independence. In my Understanding 20th Century Spain class, we talked about the beginning of the war and where it happened. Therefore, I could make connections between what I was learning and the places I was going, which was amazing. </p>

<p> Through walking tours, I could explore various barrios--the Spanish word for neighborhoods--of Madrid that I may not have thought to look at myself. My favorite thing about these walking tours is that I not only get to see the many elements of that barrio, but I also learn the historical context behind it. My first walking tour of Malasaña gave me an insight into this rebellious neighborhood. Following the end of Francisco Franco’s regime--authoritarian military dictator of Spain--the neighborhood partook in drugs, sex, and other behavior that was previously discouraged. </p>
