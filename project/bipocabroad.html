<h2> WHO I AM AND WHERE I'M GOING </h2>

<div class="section 1"> 

<img src="images/usinsevilla.JPG" alt="A group of students stand in front of a monument in Sevilla, Spain" class="floatleft">

<p> Being a member of a marginalized community in the United States is a unique experience. I am Latinx, specifically Mexican American. It comes with its joys and challenges, a culture built up by adversity and strength, dancing, good food, good music, and overall pride. However, it also comes with the anguish of never feeling you belong, microaggressions, stereotypes, expectations so below you that you start to wonder why anyone ever set them. 
</p>

<p> As a low-income individual, the intersectionality of these systemic inequalities tends to hit me all at once. Therefore, when I received the letter that I had been accepted to an already Predominantly White Institution, Syracuse University, and their Discovery Program for a first-year semester abroad in Madrid, Spain, I was both elated as well as terrified. The Euro was worth more than the dollar: How would I afford anything? I had participated in Syracuse University's Summer Start Program, a program for students funded by Student Support Services and the Higher Education Opportunity Program. These are opportunity programs, and Summer Start provided low-income first-generation students an opportunity to get an inside scoop at college before the arrival of other students. 
</p>

<p>
After returning from Summer Start, I thought about how no one from that program was coming with me abroad. That year, I was the only student from SummerStart to go abroad for Discovery. I remember feeling anxiety at the thought of being around primarily White and higher-income individuals.

<p>    
    When I got to John F. Kennedy airport the day we flew out, I remember the first girl I met was tall, blonde, and overall, my exact opposite. Once I got past bag-check and got to boarding, I realized the majority of the students there were white. Even the ones that weren't I felt disconnected from. Having grown up in the Bronx, New York my entire life, I felt very out of place knowing the majority of these individuals did not grow up like me. I remember crying before the first day of school because I was afraid. We had already spent a couple of days in Spain, and I already felt less intelligent, less knowledgeable, and overall, less of a person. 
</p>
    
<p> It was my first time in Europe, and I had only ever been out of the country one other time. How would I prove myself in an academic setting? I knew I was smart, but it was a lot easier to be smart in a room full of less intelligent individuals than in a room full of equally brilliant--if not more--individuals. However, throughout those 14 weeks in Spain, I came away with a new sense of courage and confidence in myself, unlike any other. I am writing this for the next girl like myself, one from a low-income community, a girl of color, and suffering from impostor syndrome like most of us. I have a couple of takeaways. </p>

    <h3> You are worthy. </h3>
    <p> The first midterm I took in Madrid was my EAR 104 class, Earth Science class. When I got my test back, I remember being apprehensive about my grade. I turned it over and was shocked, my first C in college. Honestly, it was my first C in my academic career. Me and my professor spoke afterward, and she agreed to let me retake it. It was easy to feel shame and embarrassment, especially knowing that no one else had struggled like that. I’d look at my white and even non-white counterparts and would feel less worthy than them. I was surrounded by individuals who were Columbia waitlists, had grown in white picket fence neighborhoods, etc. Nonetheless, it's important to remember how you got there, with fewer resources, fewer connections, and all the more fight in you.  </p>

    <h3> You are enough. </h3>   
    <p> 
        Throughout the semester, there were multiple times where I was surrounded by my friends, who were primarily white, and would hear them talk about Eurocentric topics. I remember a particular discussion in which we were discussing the Balkan Peninsula-which I now know is a region in Europe-and I was confused as to what they were speaking about. I grew up talking to people from Latin America, people from the city, etc.  It was a huge culture shock to not constantly be surrounded by people of a similar culture. However, I realized it wasn’t anything personally wrong with me. It was simply the fact that while we may have grown up in the same country, we grew up in different worlds. Mine was centered around different things than theirs.
